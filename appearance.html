    <h2>Appearance of a Bakekujira</h2>
    <p>
        The Bakekujira is not so out of place as other mythical creatures. Its appearance is that of the skeleton of a whale, with one of its alternate names being the "hone kujira",
        which translates to "bone whale". However, it is not fully inanimate as one would expect an skeleton to be, but was said to sail in the top of the sea in rainy nights.
        Some paintings feature also other animals alongside the Bakekujira, with the Bakekujira being much large in proportion to them, featuring a macabre appearance with sometimes
        a glow aura reassembling the body of a whale with the bones positioned correctly, which could have maybe tricked whale hunters into thinking it was a normal whale.
