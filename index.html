        <h2>Welcome to my webpage</h2>
        <p>
        Water bodies have always been an object of myths and legends. I've always been intrigued by mythical creatures, as some feature fascinating appearances and well-developed stories.
        The Bakekujira is a mythological creature part of Japanese Folkore, being a Yokai, which have been represented a lot in culture through artistic means. Feel free to explore this little
        website which introduces to a not so much well-known mythological creature!
        </p>
        <h3>Disclaimer: I am no expert in Yokai or Japanese folkore.There could be errors in what is described in this webpage. Sorry</h3>
        <p id="intro">Why choose Japanese folkore you may ask? I'm currently taking Japanese language courses and having heard about numerous mythological creatures,
            I decided to look at some of the famous "Yokai", and decided to go with one I had never heard before.
