                        The Bakekujira reassembles the appearance of a whale, so it was believed to be present in the Shimane Peninsula, part of the Sea of Japan. It was also
                        to appear when rain was present.

                    <p class="">
                        One of the legends sorrounding this mythical creature is that of Bakekujira being the souls of whales who were killed, a result of the
                        huge bounty they brought to fisher villages, bringing calamity and curses to those who saw it as a revenge of their death. It was described to be a vengeful ghost, similar to many
                        other Yokai.

                    <strong></strong>
                    <p class="">
                       The Bakekujira was said to bring creatures alongside it, such as fishes and birds, which were different than those the fishermans were accustomed to.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong></strong>
                    <p class="">
                        In one of the legends, when fisherman encountered the Bakekujira they tried to attack it similar to how they did their usual whale hunts, but it was unsuccesful
                        as the harpoon was not able to strike the Bakekujira.
